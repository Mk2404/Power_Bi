# 📊 Power BI Learning Path

Welcome to my **Power BI learning repository** — a collection of beginner-friendly projects that help me build core skills in **data analytics**, **SQL**, and **data visualization**.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repo documents my journey from raw data to meaningful dashboards using:
- **MySQL** for data creation, exploration & cleaning
- **Excel** for data export & formatting
- **Power BI** for interactive visualizations

As I’m just starting out, these projects are focused on learning, experimentation, and steady improvement. Mistakes are part of the process — and I’m here for all of it.
